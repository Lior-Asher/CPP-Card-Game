# Card-Game
Simple TAKI card game for two players.  
Turn based.  
Game rules are pretty simple:  
When it is your turn, select one of your carda that has the same color or the same shape as the card on top of the deck.  
Some special cards allow the current player to play another card, change the turn, stop the other player.  
The game makes it clear who's to play it is, just follow the rules :)
